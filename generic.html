									<p>Well to start. Hi I'm Kadin you friendly Executive Assistant! I live in the country of Canada and have been apart of hosting companys for over 2 years as a supervisor/manager. It all started at a company as a Sales supervisor I was incharge of all of the sales staff and making sure everyone was doing thier job right! After a while was promoted to Assistant General Manager I was then incharge of all staff and taking ideas, complaints within the company and making sure everyone was doing thier job and updating the general manager on reports and how things are going. Later I was promoted to General Manager I was then Managing the whole company and reporting to the Chief Of Staff I was so happy. We then merged with a different company their I was promoted to Chief Administrative Officer but after finding out that it was not worth it I left I was not apart of hosting companys for months I then joined a Emergency Sevices Roleplay Clan called LCDPS as a 911 communications operator. I met a lot of people that wanted to join hosting companys after a while we went and found a new company I started as a Marketing Officer I bassicly made promotions and advertisments for the company after 2 weeks I was promoted to Head Marketing Officer In charge of the whole comapny. After about 3-4 months I was finally promoted to Executive Assistant it made me so happy it was the best feeling ever to the point were I was jumping up and down at school. So we then merged to a company called Palo Alto Hosting which is were we are today. So hi i'm Kadin the Executive Assistant & VP Of Canada Operations!  </p>
