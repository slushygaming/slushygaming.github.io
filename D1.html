									<center><h2><u>Information</u></h2>
									
									<p>I created this script as a extra security to your computer. It's a simple script that is easy to do! It's made with simple vbs scripts, and with bat files. Now this is easy to get around but you need to know what to do! SO if your parents or friends are not the smartest with computers then you will be fine.</P>
                                    <p>All it does is runs the command taskkill /f /im explorer.exe /t and what this does is kills the tool bar and your wall paeper so it's a blank screen. After that a box will pop up asking for a username they have three chances and if they get it right they move on to the password but if they get it wrong to many times it will shut off the computer. If they get the password right then it will run the command "start explorer.exe" which starts the toolbar and wallpaper and you can continue with your day.</p>								
								 
								   <h2><u>Installation</h2></u>
									
									<p> In the file there will be a .bat file called begin. Create a shortcut of that file by right clicking on it and clicking create shortcut. Now press your windows key and R at the same time. a box will pop up in  this box type "shell:startup" without the quotes. Now drag the SHORTCUT you made into that file thats it it's installed.</p>
								    <h2><b><u>Customization</h2></b></u>
									
									<p> To edit the username go into the file and edit the file called login it's a vbs file. Now this is the pesky part in the file goto every part that says "PUT USERNAME HERE" And put the desired username and do the same with the password but the password file is called password.vbs so now when your done your ready to go! Now run the file called begin and test it out if it does not work press CTRL + Alt + Delete and at the top click file the run new task in there type "explorer.exe" and make sure you filled everything out correctly!</p>
